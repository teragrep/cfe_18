== Why?
* Sinks are used to indicate the first forwarding point of the Capture
** Protocol refers to Application Layer protocol (L7 OSI model), which is being used to forward Capture
* These are required before inserting a Capture, since it needs to be linked to a Capture using both:
** Flow name
** Protocol name
* That combination is why duplicate Flow and Protocol combinations are not allowed
