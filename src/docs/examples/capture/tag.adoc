= Calculating the tag

The tag is calculated from a Capture's tag_path using MD5 hashing.

Using an imaginary tag_path of:

[source, bash]
----
/opt/teragrep/capture-example-01/log_file.log
----

The expected MD5 hash of that string is:
`79822d06c9af7e23f33fb4488c55760c`.

Only the first 8 characters matter for the tag, so now we're left with: `79822d06`.

After this, the string after the last instance of the character `/` is separated, in this example this would be `log_file.log`.

* If the substring is *shorter or equal* to 23 characters, it is appended to the shortened MD5 hash using a dash:
+
[source,bash]
----
79822d06-log_file.log
----

* If the substring is longer than that, for example `log_file_that_is_super_long.log` (31 characters long), only the first 23 characters are used for appending:
+
[source,bash]
----
79822d06-log_file_that_is_super_
----
