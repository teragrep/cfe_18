== How?

=== Destination

[source]
----
${cfe_18_address}/storage/flow
----
'''

=== Request

[source,json]
----
{
  "flow": "flowName",
  "storage_id": 123
}
----

* `flow` should be a name of an added link:../flow.adoc[flow]
* `storage_id` should be the response ID from link:storage.adoc[Storage]

'''
=== Response
==== Successful request
....
HTTP Response code: 201
....
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 123,
  "message": "New flow storage created"
}
----

==== Failed requests

===== Flow does not exist
A link:../flow.adoc[flow] does not exist with the name in the request
....
HTTP Response code: 400
....
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 123,
  "message": "flow does not exist"
}
----

===== Storage is not valid
A link:storage.adoc[storage] does not exist with the id in the request
....
HTTP Response code: 400
....
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 123,
  "message": "Storage is not valid"
}
----

== Why?
* Links a link:storage.adoc[storage] to a link:../flow.adoc[flow]
* This link is necessary, since a single storage can have multiple flows delivering events to it
