= CFE_18, Integration main data management for Teragrep

CFE_18 takes advantage of relational-database standardization and MariaDB system-versioning through creating database schema according to integration data needs.

The project uses the Flyway migration strategy to ensure fault-free deployment and presents data through Swagger UI via RESTful endpoints. CFE_18 does have Spring Boot framework built-in which utilizes the framework only through endpoints. MyBatis works as a mapper between Spring boot and MariaDB database and creates queries specified within said mappers.

== Features

* CFE_18 can be used to manage integrations
* Schema structure can be modified to accommodate user needs

== Documentation

See the official documentation on https://docs.teragrep.com[docs.teragrep.com].

== Limitations

* Java 8

== How to Use

. Setup database according to end-user needs
. Can be deployed using https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/deployer-howto.html[tomcat]/JBoss

== How to Run in a Container?


NOTE: Files are stored under `quadlet/docker` directory. They are viable for containerized deployment without Quadlet.


The project requires an external database to use. CFE_18 image uses https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/[multi-stage] to build Rocky Linux 9 during the first stage as base image and installs Apache Tomcat on top of the previous stage. CFE_18.war is deployed via using Apache Tomcat.

Expected files are:

* `/etc/tomcat/Catalina/localhost/cfe-18/application.properties`
* `/etc/tomcat/Catalina/localhost/cfe-18/log4j2.xml`

Example files for configuration are:

* `/quadlet/docker/application.properties`
* `/quadlet/docker/log4j2.xml`

/quadlet/docker/application.properties requires configuring:

* spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mariadb://127.0.0.1:3306/cfe_18
* spring.datasource.username = username
* spring.datasource.password = password
* spring.datasource.driver-class-name = org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver

MariaDB must be used as the database solution for CFE_18 containerized deployment, when using CFE_18 image. It is required since CFE_18 takes advantage of MariaDB's https://mariadb.com/kb/en/system-versioned-tables/[system-versioned tables].

.Example run command
[source,console]
----
$ docker run -ti  -v /quadlet/docker/application.properties:/etc/tomcat/Catalina/localhost/cfe-18/application.properties:ro -v /quadlet/docker/log4j2.xml:/etc/tomcat/Catalina/localhost/cfe-18/log4j2.xml:ro  -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/teragrep/cfe_18:latest
----
Please notice that in the example command above:

1. `application.properties` and `log4j2.xml` are mounted accordingly.
2. 8080:8080 are for external and internal ports.
3. ghcr.io/teragrep/cfe_18:latest image from Githubs image repository



=== How to run container with Quadlet

https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html[See also the Quadlet's documentation.]

IMPORTANT: This is the recommended deployment style for containerized deployment. Running Podman containers without Quadlets results them not starting independently after host reboots.


==== Docker directory

Files inside the directory are required for Apache Tomcat to deploy CFE_18. They are explained in the section `How to Run in a Container?`

==== docker-entrypoint-initdb.d directory

Files inside the directory are required for MariaDB to initialize with the correct databases intact.
See also MariaDB https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb[initialization script documentation for initializing the database contents].

==== cfe18.container

The following Quadlet file is required to deploy CFE_18 Podman container as a system service. The example below is from `quadlet/cfe18.container`.

The following Quadlet file is inserted under `/etc/containers/systemd` on the host machine. See more on https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html[Podman Quadlet docs].

==== cfe18mariadb.container

The following Quadlet file is required to deploy MariaDB Podman container as system service. Example below is from `quadlet/cfe18mariadb.container`.

The following Quadlet file is inserted under `/etc/containers/systemd` on the host machine. See more on https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html[Podman Quadlet docs].
